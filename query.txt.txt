query menghitung total
SELECT sf.Exca, SUM(temporary.tonase) AS Total_Tonase
FROM temporary
INNER JOIN setting_dt AS dt ON temporary.setting_dt = dt.id_setting_dt
INNER JOIN setting_fleet as sf ON dt.id_setting_fleet = sf.Id_setting
GROUP BY sf.Exca;


menggabungkan total berdasarkan nama dt,loading,dumping
SELECT dt.Nama_DT, SUM(temporary.tonase) AS Total_Tonase
FROM temporary
INNER JOIN setting_dt AS dt ON temporary.setting_dt = dt.id_setting_dt
GROUP BY dt.Nama_DT, temporary.loading_point,temporary.dumping_point;


menghitung ritase
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(created, '%Y-%m-%d %H:00:00') AS hour, COUNT(*) AS ritase_per_hour FROM temporary WHERE setting_dt = 1 GROUP BY hour ORDER BY hour;
